# Library-App
A simple JavaScript web app that lets you create, view, update, and remove books from a personal library — all in your browser.

## Features
Add New Books – Title, Author, Pages, and Read Status.

Toggle Read Status – Mark a book as read/unread.

Remove Books – Delete a book from the library.

Unique IDs – Each book is assigned a unique crypto.randomUUID() so DOM and data stay linked.

Data/UI Separation – All book data is stored in an array; UI is generated dynamically from that array.
